# ARBrickWall
An AR app that allows users to build a brick wall of different brick sizes and materials

The ARBrickWall project files can be accessed in Assets/Scenes/ARBrickWall. The scene name is simpleAR.
Scripts written by me can be accessed in ARBrickWall/Scripts.

In this project, the user can detect a plane and build a brick wall in x direction with the choice of changing bricks of different sizes and colors. The wall can be saved and loaded later.
